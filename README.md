- Benefit Calculator is a convenient and easy-to-use tool designed to determine the most cost-effective purchase among several products with different prices, weights, volumes, or quantities.

  For example, you need to buy powder detergent. You found it priced at 289.99 ₽ for 1.3 kg, 459.99 ₽ for 3 kg, and there's also a discounted option priced at 129.99 ₽ for 700 grams. Which one is more cost-effective? Is the discounted one really the best deal?

  The Benefit Calculator allows you to simply fill in the fields, specifying the price and weight, volume, or quantity depending on the unit of measurement for the product. These can be grams of chips, liters of bottled water, kilograms of plaster, or bags of tea.
